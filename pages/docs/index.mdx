# Welcome to Shin Protocol

### What's Shin (Protocol)?

Shin Protocol provides a two-way proof to verify humanity/credibility of a user on chain without losing anonymity and staying decentralized. Shin is a platform where you can prove your authenticity by completing [tracks](/docs/factors#tracks) & [quests](/docs/factors#quests) which are mostly decentralized. By doing this - you would increase your trust score which, other dApps would use to prove your humanity.

### Why Shin?

Most dApps currently use KYC for verification, but it's time-consuming + complicated and not decentralized. Shin Protocol uses on-chain trust calculation based on multiple factors to verify users without exposing personal information.
This benefits both users and dApps by avoiding the need for complicated KYC processes and document verification.

**Users only need to complete the verification process once, and any dApp using Shin Protocol can call the [API](/docs/api/) for easy verification.**
